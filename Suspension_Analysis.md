# SUSPENSION SYSTEM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

The suspension system is one of the most critical subsystems of an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) as it directly affects ride comfort, handling stability, durability, and overall vehicle safety. The primary function of the suspension system is to absorb shocks from uneven terrain while maintaining continuous tire contact with the ground, thereby ensuring effective traction and control.

In BAJA competitions, the suspension system plays a vital role in all three events: Static, Dynamic, and Endurance. During static evaluation, suspension design is assessed based on geometry, calculations, adjustability, and justification. In dynamic events, the suspension must efficiently absorb impacts from bumps, jumps, and rough terrain while maintaining vehicle stability. In endurance races, the suspension must operate reliably for long durations without failure.

The objective of this study is to design and analyze the front and rear suspension systems of a BAJA ATV, ensuring adequate wheel travel, appropriate spring and damping characteristics, favorable suspension geometry, and balanced front–rear ride dynamics.

## II. METHODOLOGY

Considering the operating conditions of BAJA competitions, the suspension system is designed to withstand high impact loads, repeated shock inputs, and rough terrain conditions. The design methodology focuses on achieving an optimal balance between ride comfort, handling performance, and structural durability.

The suspension system is designed using a requirement-based approach, supported by vehicle dynamics principles and empirical data from previous BAJA vehicles.

The methodology adopted for suspension design and analysis is as follows:

1. Selection of suspension type based on performance and packaging requirements  
2. Determination of wheel travel limits  
3. Calculation of motion ratios  
4. Selection of spring rates and damping coefficients  
5. Suspension geometry design and kinematic analysis  
6. Evaluation of roll, camber, toe, caster, and roll center characteristics  
7. Verification of front–rear suspension balance

## IV. CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS

### 1. Wheel Rate Calculation

Wheel rate is calculated using the relation:

Wheel Rate = Spring Rate × (Motion Ratio)²

**Front Suspension:**

Wheel Rate = 7.07 × (0.64)²  
Wheel Rate = 5.25 N/mm  

**Rear Suspension:**

Wheel Rate = 16.2 × (0.73)²  
Wheel Rate = 5.7 N/mm

### 2. Sprung Mass Natural Frequency

The natural frequency of the suspension system determines ride comfort and handling characteristics.

- Front Suspension Natural Frequency = 1.3 Hz  
- Rear Suspension Natural Frequency = 1.61 Hz  

A lower natural frequency at the front improves obstacle compliance, while a higher rear frequency improves stability and traction during acceleration.

---

### 3. Roll Rate Analysis

Roll rate analysis ensures that body roll remains within acceptable limits during cornering and uneven terrain traversal.

- Front Roll Rate = 11.12 deg/g  
- Rear Stabilizer Stiffness = 700.64 N/m  

This roll distribution provides balanced handling characteristics without inducing excessive understeer or oversteer.
