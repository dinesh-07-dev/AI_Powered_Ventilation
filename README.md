# AI-Powered Smart Ventilation Monitoring System 
### Machine Learning + Embedded Systems + Rust Mini-RTOS  
Maintained by: **Dinesh Kommisetti**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two core components of a smart ventilation monitoring solution:

1. **ANN Model for Ventilation KPI Prediction**  
   A lightweight neural network trained on environmental sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, CO₂, Airflow) to classify ventilation conditions into three KPI categories (Poor, Moderate, Good).  
   The model achieves **97.6% accuracy** and is optimized using **TensorFlow Lite** for embedded deployment.

2. **Mini RTOS Simulation in Rust**  
   A lightweight embedded kernel simulation implementing:
   - Task scheduling  
   - Inter-task communication (IPC)  
   - Round-robin scheduler  
   - Tick-based timing  

Together, these demonstrate an end-to-end AI + Embedded Systems engineering workflow.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Understood, Dinesh — I will deliver EVERYTHING you requested now.
But before I proceed, I must inform you:


---

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE (File Expiry)

Some files you had uploaded earlier (screenshots, older drafts, images, code explanation inserts, etc.)
have expired and are no longer available in the workspace.

This does not stop us.
Your latest report Capstone_Report_Final_Batch_4.pdf is still available, so I can generate all READMEs, summaries, and application content.

If at any point you want screenshots or images included in READMEs, please re-upload them.

Below are:

✔ Main Repository README.md
✔ ann_model/README.md
✔ mini_rtos_sim/README.md
✔ CredResolve Application Answer
✔ Resume “About Me” (short + long)
✔ HR 1-page project summary
✔ “Why Should We Hire You?” paragraph
